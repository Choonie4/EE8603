# Abstract
This report employs the CatBoost Regressor to predict red wine alcohol content using nine features. Various strategies, including feature removal and outlier elimination, were explored for performance enhancement. Surprisingly, the original dataset yielded the best results, with the CatBoost Regressor consistently outperforming other models. Performance metrics, including RMSE, R2, and MAPE, confirmed the model's accuracy. The study concludes that the CatBoost Regressor, applied to the unaltered dataset, provides the most effective prediction of red wine alcohol content.
